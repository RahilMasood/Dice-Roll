# Dice Roll App

Welcome to the Dice Roll App! This simple application allows users to roll a virtual dice and display the result. It's built using Flutter and Dart, making it a great starting point for those new to mobile app development and so I followed it.

## Features

- Roll a dice with a simple tap
- Display the result of the dice roll
- User-friendly interface
